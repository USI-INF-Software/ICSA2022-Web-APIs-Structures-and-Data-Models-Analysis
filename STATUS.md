## This application is for the Results Reproduced (ROR-R) and Results Replicated (RER) badges. 

In this repository we share both the raw results plotted and discussed in the paper and the dataset used to compute the metrics.
The obtained results can be reproduced by analysing the specification of APIs we share in the dataset, folowing the analysis approach explained in the paper.
